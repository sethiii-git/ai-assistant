AI Response: The **capital of India is New Delhi**[1][2][3][5].

New Delhi is located in the north-central part of India, on the west bank of the Yamuna River[1]. It was formally declared the capital in 1911, when King George V announced the transfer of the capital of British India from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi[1][2]. Construction of the city began in 1912, and the new capital was formally inaugurated in 1931[2].

**Background and Key Facts:**

- **New Delhi serves as the seat of all three branches of the Government of India:** the Executive (Rashtrapati Bhavan, or Presidential Palace), the Legislature (Sansad Bhavan, or Parliament House), and the Judiciary (Supreme Court)[2].
- New Delhi is technically a municipality within the larger National Capital Territory of Delhi (often just called Delhi), and it covers primarily an area known as Lutyens’ Delhi[2][3]. However, in both official and everyday use, New Delhi refers to the area where the Indian government is based and is recognized as the country&#39;s national capital[2].
- The city was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, with a focus on wide avenues and grand government buildings[2].
- Old Delhi, located in the north, is the historic core, while New Delhi, to the south, represents the modern, governmental face of the capital since India gained independence in 1947[3].
- The broader Delhi metropolitan region is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, encompassing both Old Delhi, New Delhi, and adjoining cities and rural areas[3].
- New Delhi is known for its significant historical monuments, diverse markets, and as a central hub for India&#39;s political and economic activity[1].

To summarize, **New Delhi** is the officially designated capital of India, hosting the central governmental institutions and playing a vital role in the country’s history and governance[1][2][3][5].

AI Response: The **capital of India is New Delhi**[1][3][4]. 

**Background Context and Key Facts:**

- **New Delhi** is officially designated as the national capital and serves as the seat of all three branches of the Government of India: the executive (including the Rashtrapati Bhavan or Presidential Palace), the legislative (Sansad Bhavan or Parliament House), and the judiciary (the Supreme Court)[1][3]. It is administered as part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), which is a union territory that includes a much larger city and metropolitan area[1][5].

- **Location:** New Delhi is situated in the north-central part of India, on the west bank of the Yamuna River, adjacent to the historic center known as Old Delhi[3][5]. The capital region forms a key part of the Delhi metropolitan area, one of the largest urban agglomerations in the country[1][5].

- **Historical Development:** Before New Delhi, the capital of British India was Calcutta (now Kolkata). In December 1911, King George V of Britain announced that the capital would be moved to Delhi. Construction of New Delhi began in 1912, and the city was formally inaugurated as the new capital in 1931[1][3]. It was designed by British architects **Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker** and is often referred to as Lutyens&#39; Delhi in the areas built during that era[1].
